# Picbox
Automatically saves photos and videos liked on Instagram to Dropbox account.

Initially, this project was launched at [picbox.io](https://picbox.io). When Instagram [announced platform update](http://developers.instagram.com/post/133424514006/instagram-platform-update), "like" permission for Picbox was revoked. It means end of the Picbox and I'm open sourcing the project code for anyone with an intention to improve, modify, re-publish the project with diffent/additional features.
